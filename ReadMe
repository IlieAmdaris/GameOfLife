GavemOfLive v.1.0
Features:
Press P to pause the simulation
Press B to unpause the simulation
Press L to load a pattern
Press S to save a pattern
Left Click to create a green cell
Right Click to create a virus
The rules are the same for a cell and for a virus but if a cell were to be born the prefab will be the prefab that is the most common among the cell's neighbours
The top left quarter randomly revives or kills a cell and assigns to it a random prefab,this action is repeated 20 times for each frame.
The top right quarter has different rules
The bottom half has normal rules
One of the known flaws is the gameObject management, for the sake of saving time, we didn't optimize the creation and destruction of game cells
And as such the cells are continuously created causing the frame rate to drop after some time, but since this issue doesn't appear soon enough to hinder the observation
of the existing features the game development team has decided to leave this issue for the day one patch.
